      title: "Does Keploy send your private data to any cloud server for test generation?",
      answer: "No, Keploy does not send any user code to remote systems, except when using the unit test generation feature. When using the UT gen feature, only the source code and the unit test code will be sent to the Large Language Model (LLM) you are using. By default, Keploy uses - litellm to support vast number of LLM backends. Yes, if your organization has its own LLM(a private one), you can use it with Keploy. This ensures that data is not sent to any external systems.",
